NAME
----
wslogd - weather station logger daemon


SYNOPSIS
--------
*wslogd* [*-h*] [*-V*] [*-c* _path_] [*-D*] [*-i* _freq_]


DESCRIPTION
-----------
The *wslogd* command starts the weather station logger.

It connects to the device, fetches weather data, and sends it to various
locations, like a SQLite database, or a Weather Underground account.

When the daemon reads from the device, it requests an exclusive lock using
the *flock*(2) function, and releases that lock on completion. That is, this is
safe to use tools with the same locking mechanism while the daemon is running,
like all utilities from the 'wslog' suite. 

See *wslogd.conf*(5) for more details on configuration.


OPTIONS
-------
*-c* _path_::
Path of *wslogd* configuration file. Default: '/etc/wslogd.conf'.
    
*-D*::
Do not modify anything; just log what would be done.
+
In dry mode, nothing is committed to database backends, and remote sites are not
updated with new data. Should be used for testing purpose only. 

*-i* _freq_::
Set archive frequency to _freq_, in seconds.
+
If set, it overrides the 'archive.freq' configuration parameter.

*-h*::
